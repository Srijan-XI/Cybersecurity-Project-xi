## How to Use

### Option 1: Direct Execution (Interactive Mode)
1. Navigate to `build/exe.win-amd64-3.13/`
2. Double-click `ssl_tls_scanner.exe`
3. Follow the prompts to enter domain names
4. Reports will be saved in the `reports/` folder

### Option 2: Using the Batch File
1. Double-click `run_scanner.bat` in the main directory
2. The batch file will display a nice interface and run the scanner
3. Follow the prompts to enter domain names

### Option 3: Command-Line Version (For Automation)
1. Navigate to `build/exe.win-amd64-3.13/`
2. Use `ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe` with command-line arguments:
   ```
   ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe google.com github.com
   ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe -f hostnames.txt
   ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe --batch google.com -o custom_report.txt
   ```

### Option 4: Install to User Directory
1. Run `setup.bat` as administrator (optional)
2. This will copy the executable to `%USERPROFILE%\SSLScanner\`
3. Creates a convenient batch file for easy access
4. You can then run the scanner from the installed location

## Usage Instructions

### Interactive Mode (ssl_tls_scanner.exe)
1. When you run the executable, you'll be prompted to enter hostnames
2. Type each hostname (e.g., `google.com`, `github.com`) and press Enter
3. Type `done` when you've entered all hostnames
4. The scanner will check each SSL/TLS certificate and generate a report
5. Reports are saved in the `reports/scan_report.txt` file

### Command-Line Mode (ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe)
- **Direct hostnames**: `ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe hostname1 hostname2 hostname3`
- **From file**: `ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe -f hostnames.txt`
- **Custom output**: `ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe -o custom_report.txt hostname1`
- **Batch mode**: `ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe --batch hostname1 hostname2`
- **Help**: `ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe --help`

## Quick Start Examples

### Interactive Mode
```batch
# Run the easy batch file
run_scanner.bat

# Or directly run the executable
build\exe.win-amd64-3.13\ssl_tls_scanner.exe
```

### Command-Line Mode Examples
```batch
# Scan specific hostnames
build\exe.win-amd64-3.13\ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe google.com github.com

# Scan from file
build\exe.win-amd64-3.13\ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe -f sample_hostnames.txt

# Custom output location
build\exe.win-amd64-3.13\ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe -o my_report.txt google.com

# Batch mode (no prompts)
build\exe.win-amd64-3.13\ssl_tls_scanner_cli.exe --batch -f sample_hostnames.txt
```

### Installation
```batch
# Run setup for permanent installation
setup.bat
```

## Example Usage Session
```
Enter the hostnames to scan (type 'done' to finish):
Enter hostname: google.com
Enter hostname: github.com
Enter hostname: stackoverflow.com
Enter hostname: done

SSL scan completed. Report saved to reports/scan_report.txt.
```

## Report Information
The generated report includes:
- Hostname
- Certificate issuer
- Certificate subject
- Valid from date
- Valid to date
- Certificate status (Valid/Expired/Expiring Soon)
