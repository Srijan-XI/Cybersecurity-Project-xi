# Port Scanner Requirements
# This project uses only Python standard libraries

# No external dependencies required
# All functionality is built using:
# - socket (network operations)
# - threading (multi-threading)
# - ipaddress (IP validation)
# - queue (thread-safe queues)
# - argparse (command line parsing)
# - time (timing operations)
# - signal (signal handling)
# - sys, os (system operations)

# For development/testing (optional):
# pytest>=6.0
# flake8>=3.8
